description: Clone a repository from Neon Organization into the work folder
---

This workflow helps you clone repositories from the `neon` organization into your dedicated `work` folder.

1. Open your terminal in the workspace root.
2. Run the following command (replace `<repo-name>` with the actual name):
// turbo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neon/<repo-name>.git work/<repo-name>
```
3. After cloning, the new folder will automatically appear under the "Neon Work Projects" folder in your Work workspace.
